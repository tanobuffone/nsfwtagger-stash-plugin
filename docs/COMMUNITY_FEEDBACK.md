## Feedback Analysis Framework

### Categorization
- **Bug Reports**: Code issues, crashes, unexpected behavior
- **Feature Requests**: New capabilities and enhancements
- **Performance Issues**: Speed, memory, resource usage problems
- **Usability Issues**: UI/UX problems and workflow improvements
- **Documentation Issues**: Missing or unclear documentation
- **Compatibility Issues**: Problems with different environments/versions

### Prioritization Matrix
```
Impact × Frequency × Feasibility
```

Where:
- **Impact**: How much this affects users (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Frequency**: How often this issue occurs (Common/Occasional/Rare)
- **Feasibility**: How easy this is to implement (Easy/Medium/Hard)

### Scoring Examples
- **Critical + Common + Easy** = Immediate priority
- **High + Occasional + Medium** = Standard priority
- **Medium + Rare + Hard** = Future consideration
- **Low + Rare + Hard** = May not implement
